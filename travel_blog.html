            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>Thanks for stopping by. I am Savitha, the founders of one of the top 10 travel blogs in the world according to Forbes.</p>            
            <p>10 years ago we left my job, sold everything we owned, and struck out on an adventure that not only changed our lives but inspired others to step out of their comfort zone and enrich their lives through travel.</p>

                               <p>If you’re worried about getting bored by yourself, how does rafting down the Amazon or ziplining with monkeys in Costa Rica sound? Head to any of the best places to travel alone in your 20s and you’ll find like-minded adventurers! An adventure abroad is the perfect way to meet other adrenaline-junkies, and there is a special level of friendship that only jumping into an ocean full of sharks or dirt biking across deserts brings about. Plus, you can scream all you want and your BFF/younger brother won’t be there to make fun of you.</p>
